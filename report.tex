% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions worldwide, leading to severe health complications if not managed properly. Early prediction and diagnosis are crucial in preventing these complications. Machine learning offers a promising approach to predict diabetes by analyzing patterns in medical data. This project aims to leverage various machine learning models to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, a well-known dataset in the medical research community.

% Dataset Description
\section{Dataset Description}
The Pima Indians Diabetes Database consists of 768 samples, each with 8 features and a binary outcome indicating the presence or absence of diabetes. The features include Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age. Each feature provides valuable insights into the patient's health, contributing to the prediction of diabetes.

% Methodology
\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Data Cleaning}
Data cleaning involved handling missing values by imputing them with the median of the respective feature. Outliers were identified and treated using z-score analysis to ensure data quality.
\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}
EDA was conducted to explore feature distributions and correlations. Significant correlations were observed between Glucose levels and the Outcome, highlighting its importance in diabetes prediction.
\subsection{Model Building}
Five machine learning models were built: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN. Each model was selected based on its ability to handle binary classification tasks and its interpretability.
\subsection{Hyperparameter Tuning}
GridSearchCV was employed to tune hyperparameters for each model. The tuning process involved evaluating combinations of parameters to identify the best-performing model configuration.

% Results
\section{Results}
The Logistic Regression model achieved the highest accuracy of approximately 77\%. Detailed performance metrics for each model, including precision, recall, and F1-score, are presented in Table 1. Confusion matrices for each model are shown in Figure 1.

% Discussion
\section{Discussion}
The results indicate that Logistic Regression is effective for this dataset, likely due to its simplicity and ability to handle linear relationships. Challenges included handling missing data and selecting appropriate hyperparameters. Future work could explore deep learning models to capture more complex patterns.

% Conclusion
\section{Conclusion}
This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting diabetes. The findings suggest that machine learning models, particularly Logistic Regression, can effectively predict diabetes, aiding in early diagnosis and management.

% Future Work
\section{Future Work}
Future improvements include deploying the model using Streamlit or Flask for real-time predictions, integrating ROC-AUC and Precision-Recall Curves for better evaluation, and exploring deep learning approaches to enhance prediction accuracy.
